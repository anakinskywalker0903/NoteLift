# NoteLift

NoteLift is a Chrome Extension that helps students turn highlighted text from
web pages and PDFs into clean, module-wise revision notes.

### How NoteLift Works with PDFs
NoteLift is designed for active study. As you read a PDF or PPT, select and copy
important text sections and capture them into NoteLift. You can do this multiple
times across a document or across days.

When you are done studying a module, export all captured notes at once into a
single file.

## Features
